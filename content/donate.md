Wartime Aide is a non-profit organization completely run by volunteer students. This means no Wartime Aide chapter member, director, or officer is compensated for their work. All of your donation is credited towards areas related to Wartime Aide's mission:

1. Internal costs (filling fees, domain payments, fundraising projects, etc.). Without covering these costs Wartime Aide is not able to sustain itself as an organization and fulfill its mission. 

2. Our Podcast!. [Click here]({{< ref "podcast.md" >}}) for more information.
