Wartime Aide was founded by a group of high school students within the city of Boston who recognized the gruesome effects of violent wars occurring in the Middle East, Sub-Saharan Africa, and around the world. As a result of these conflicts, the world faces one of the worst refugee crises since World War II. Being well aware of this epidemic, these students knew that education is the best way to counteract this injustice worldwide. This led to the founding of the charity Wartime Aide.
