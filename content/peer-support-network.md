What makes Wartime Aide truly unique is its peer support network. Wartime Aide works with local resettlement agencies to set up a line of contact between our chapters. This allows these resettlement groups to enlist the help of our chapters in welcoming a refugee to a community. Wartime Aide does this to make sure there is a group of students supporting a refugee as they transition to a new school, community, job, and country. Chapter members brainstorm ideas on how to build this peer support network. This may include offering free babysitting for a refugee family, free tutoring in English and for their schoolwork, involving a refugee teen in school social activities and more.

The purpose of this is to serve the needs of the refugee not the curiosity of our chapter members. Although Wartime Aide does hope our chapters find their service meaningful and impactful the priority should be serving the refugee. This also means treating a refugee with the utmost respect. Wartime Aide makes sure each of our chapter members understands that the refugees being served should not be viewed as inferior but their equals.
