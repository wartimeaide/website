Wartime Aide chapters follow a three-step process: 

1. Educate themselves and other high schoolers about refugee issues using Wartime Aide's curriculum and discussion guides.
2. Reach out to teenage refugees coming to their school and their community in order to build a peer-support network.
3. To raise funds on behalf of Wartime Aide.
